tests are within the package

please note: `pyramid_oauthlib_lowlevel.tests.oauth2_app` and  `pyramid_oauthlib_lowlevel.tests.oauth1_app` are both fully functional example oAuth applications. They each implement an Authority Server and Client Application Server.

while there are only 6 tests, each test is an oauth flow, and tests for success and expected failures.

there are some envrionment variables that can help control tests and application usage:

`export PYRAMID_OAUTHLIB_LOWLEVEL__PRINT_ERRORS=1`

	prints an error message when @catch_backend_failure is encountered.
	an error message is always logged. this just prints the error too.

`export PYRAMID_OAUTHLIB_LOWLEVEL__DEBUG_ROUTE=1`
`export PYRAMID_OAUTHLIB_LOWLEVEL__DEBUG_USERID=1`
`export PYRAMID_OAUTHLIB_LOWLEVEL__LOG_ROUTE=1`
	
	extra debugging during tests
